# python exception handling

## Module 2, Lesson 7

'''
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to enhance your understanding of exception handling by creating a weather forecast application that gracefully handles unexpected user input and provides user-friendly error messages.

Task 1: Start Begin by asking the user to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit.

Task 2: Temperature Conversion Write a function that converts the Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. Remember that the formula is (Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9.

Use a try block to catch any potential errors during the conversion process. What happens if they type out "thirty" instead of doing 30?

Task 3: User Experience Implement an else block that prints the converted temperature in a user-friendly format. 

Example: "100 degrees Fahrenheit is 37.78 degrees Celsius."

Task 4: Finally Add a finally block that thanks the user for using the weather forecast application, ensuring that this message is displayed regardless of whether an exception was caught or not.
